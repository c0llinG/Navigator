# Dodge Game
Simple, poorly written but semi fun arcade game, written in Python using PyGame



Themed version in /SpaceTheme - pixel art by @guetta.rt on instagram

-Issues:

    -dodge.py works better, space.py looks better
    
/SpaceTheme/space.py:
    -obstacles are not aligned properly
    -game ends when meteor textures are exhausted
