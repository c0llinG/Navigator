### Simple and addictive arcade game written in Python with PyGame ###

-The game is not rocket science, despite the theme. Navigate between randomly placed tokens like the game "Snake", with the twist of avoiding increasingly unforgiving asteroids- and whatever else may be out there.

-Very much a work in progress, and any suggestions or feedback would be welcome. This is my first real attempt at making software, so bear with me! :)
